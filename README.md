## 1. Introduction
The Furuta Pendulum consists of a driven arm which rotates in the horizontal plane and a pendulum attached to that arm that is free to rotate in the vertical plane. The goal of the project is to use a control system to balance a beam up vertically by controlling the motors position on a gantry. With 2 encoders that measure the position of the motor in 360 degree circle and the angle of the beam with respect to the floor , the system will keep the beam upright and from falling by moving to the location needed to balance the beam to a 90 degree angle. This project is purely virtual, our group is using MAT LAB and SIMULINK to demonstrate the inverted pendulum project with linear and non-linear control algorithms.
